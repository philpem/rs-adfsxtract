# Disk-format coverage matrix

This is the authoritative statement of *which on-disk formats and format
features* `acornfsextract` is known to handle and how each is tested. It is
generated/reported from `src/format_coverage_tests.rs` (report-only: the test
always passes and just prints the matrix, so CI surfaces regressions in format
breadth without failing the build on a coverage shortfall).

Ground truth is **real media authored by the official Acorn tools**, never
this project's own builder and not a second reader (the `filecore-extract`
reference tool is retired). A synthetic/self-generated image is only ever
trusted as a *carrier* or an *edge-case*; its expected values are derived from
an official-tool golden before they are baked into a test.

## Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `real` | Exercised against a real (official-tool) disc image. |
| `real (runtime)` | Exercised against real media fetched at runtime (key-gated, never committed, no pinned hash/name). |
| `synthetic` | Exercised against an in-repo generated image, but cross-checked against an official golden. |
| `synthetic-only` | Exercised only against an in-repo generated image; no golden anchor yet. |
| `uncovered` | No test; risk of silent mis-parsing. |
| `refused` | Recognised but deliberately rejected (a supported-limitation), with an explicit test. |

## FileCore (ADFS) / FileCore structures

Columns: **map** (old/new) × **dir** (old/new/big) × **geometry** ×
**interleave** × **zones** × **fragmentation**.

| Cell | Map | Dir | Geometry | Interleave | Zones | Status | Fixture / test |
|------|-----|-----|----------|-----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| S | old | old | 160 KB, 40 trk × 1 side | sequential→interleaved | 1 | `synthetic-only` (golden pending) | `sml_geometry` unit 640; S/M reference (pending) |
| M | old | old | 320 KB, 80 trk × 1 side | sequential→interleaved | 1 | `synthetic-only` (golden pending) | `sml_geometry` unit 1280; S/M reference (pending) |
| L | old | old | 640 KB, 80 trk × 2 sides | sequential→interleaved | 1 | `real` | `data/adfs640L.adl.gz` |
| D | old | new | 800 KB, 80 trk × 2 sides, 1024 B sect | interleaved | 1 | `real` | `data/adfs800D.adf.gz` |

| F | new | new | 1.6 MB, 10 sect/trk | interleaved | 4 | `real` | `data/adfs1600F.adf.gz` |
| E+ | new | big | 800 KB | interleaved | 1 | `synthetic-only` (real media available via corpus scan) | `testutil` `big_dirs` |
| F+ | new | big | 1.6 MB | interleaved | 4 | `synthetic-only` (real floppies exist in corpora) | `testutil` `big_dirs` |
| G | new | big | hard disc | interleaved | n | `synthetic-only` (real media available via corpus scan) | `testutil` `big_dirs` |
| Old-map hard disc | old | old(small) | 256 B sect, drive-geometry | linear | 1 | `synthetic-only` (opt-in corpus scan validates real media at runtime) | `oldmap_hard_disc_tests` (synthetic) + `corpus_tests` — real media (a 1984 Acorn Winchester File Server) shows old/small `0x500` dirs at `0x200`, linear addressing, disc_size = image length, and an uncomputed (zero) directory check byte; the guide's `0x400`/`0x800` new-dir assumption is corrected |
| New-map sequential track order | new | new | any | sequential flag set | n | `refused` | synthetic refusal test |

### Fragmentation (new map)

| Feature | Status | Test |
|---------|--------|------|
| Single zone, file in 2 same-id fragments | `synthetic` | `testutil::fragmented_file_reassembles_in_order` |
| File in >2 fragments | `uncovered` | seeded random generator (pending) |
| Cross-zone fragment span (`pending_span`) | `uncovered` | seeded random generator (pending) |
| Sharing offset on a non-root object | `synthetic-only` | `build_new_map_disc`/big-dir paths |

| Free-chain exclusion interacting with real fragments | `synthetic` | `map_new` unit tests |
| Real-media fragmentation | `real (runtime)` | Arcology key-gated `hard_disc_fragmentation_against_arcology_corpus` (14/15 sampled real `.dd` hard discs had fragmented files) |

### Structural / metadata features

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Boot block present (F format / hard disc) | `real` (`adfs1600F`) |
| Boot block absent (S/M/L/D, E) | `real` (L/D/E) |
| Disc-record zone-0 vs boot-block merge | `real` |

## DFS (Disc Filing System)

Columns: **vendor** × **geometry** (SSD/DSD, 40/80 trk, sect/trk) × **catalogue features**.

| Cell | Vendor | Geometry | Status | Fixture / test |
|------|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Acorn DFS SSD | Acorn | single-sided | `real` | `data/apd01_ssd.ssd.gz` (`dfs_reference_media_tests`) |
| Acorn DFS DSD | Acorn | double-sided interleaved | `real` | `data/8bs0_dsd.dsd.gz` (`dfs_reference_media_tests`) |

| Solidisk / Opus catalogue | Solidisk/Opus | — | `real` | `data/solidisk_utils_side_a.ssd.gz` (real Solidisk DDFS utilities disc) + synthetic/Eagle_Empire external; DDFS is a density enhancement, not a layout change |
| HADFS (Harston) | HADFS | — | `real (runtime)` | mdfs.net `Software/HADFS/System.ssd` (unsupported variant; must not crash on DFS detection) |
| dir-char / locked attributes on real media | any | — | `real` | `data/apd01_ssd.ssd.gz` (G/U dir chars) |
| Catalogue bounds / broken entry | any | — | `synthetic` | `scenario_tests` |

## External real-disc validation (opt-in)

`external_real_media_tests` pulls additional real discs at runtime from
**8bs.com**, **mdfs.net** and **bbcmicro.co.uk** (URL + SHA-256 pinned,
self-skips unless `ACORNFS_EXTERNAL_SOURCE` is set to a cache directory). It
validates the tool against more real media and feeds real-media facts back into
the matrix, but is **never** a committed-test dependency. Sources found:
- 8bs.com - public-domain BBC/Master discs (ADFS L/E and DFS).
- mdfs.net - J.G.Harston's freely-distributed software (Acorn DFS discs) and an
  HADFS System disc (unsupported variant).
- bbcmicro.co.uk - a large archive of real Acorn DFS game discs (single- and
  double-sided; a few are truncated/100 KB, which is an extra edge case).
- The BBC Lives mirror at rk.nvg.ntnu.no - genuine Watford DFS discs (the
  62-file extension), including one that exposed a real reader bug (see the
  divergence note under `dfs/watford-62`).
- Stardot - a Solidisk-recovered single-density game disc (sweh's archive
  posts).

Stardot.org.uk is primarily forums plus links out to mdfs.net and
retrosoftware.co.uk; it does not host a crawlable disc/hard-disc image archive,
so it is not used as a source. Genuine RISC OS hard-disc images (the source of
real new-map fragmentation) live on Arcology and are covered by the key-gated
fragmentation harness (see above).

## Authoring / independent generator

- `tools/GOLDEN_AUTHORING.md` - the recipe for creating real media with the
  official Acorn tools and handing goldens back for hashing.
- `tools/filecore_build.py` - an independent single-zone E-format builder used
  as a cross-check oracle and hard-disc/big-dir generator (see
  `tools/README.md`).

## Partitioned ADFS hard discs (recognised-by-analysis, not yet exercised)

Some real RISC OS hard discs are partitioned using **Acorn-specific schemes**
(not MBR/GPT): ICS/Baildon IDEFS, HCCS, SJ Research Nexus and Simtec. The
Arcology analysis code (`worker/arcworker/tools/partition.py`) documents their
layout, including that each partition carries its own FileCore boot block at
`partition_start + 0xC00` (disc record at `+0x1C0`), and the signatures:
- ICS - a "Part"-seeded checksum over sector 0 and `(start_sector,size_sector)`
  entries.
- HCCS - an `Andy` magic at boot-block `+0x1B0`, with contiguous partitions
  whose length is the disc record's `disc_size`.
- Nexus - a `Net1` magic at `0x20000`.
- Simtec - a signature detector.

We do not yet scan for these; a disc that is partitioned this way would not be
recognised at offset 0. The diagnostic drives probed (ConnerCP2024, ST3660A,
FireballSE1.2) use none of these signatures - they are either non-ADFS or
damaged/truncated dumps (e.g. ConnerCP2024 is a 7.5 MB image whose disc record
claims 13 MB), so partitioning is not the cause of their non-recognition.
Supporting these schemes is a follow-up if such media is needed.

## Coverage tooling`cargo llvm-cov` (with `llvm-tools-preview`) reports line/branch coverage as a
secondary, report-only metric. This matrix — not a coverage threshold — is the
authoritative statement of *format* breadth.

Baseline against the full library test suite (unit + all always-on reference
images): **line 89.60%, branch 92.16%** (`cargo llvm-cov --summary-only --lib`).
The notably low modules are the CLI/binary and diagnostic paths that the
library test suite doesn't drive directly:

| Module | Line | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| `cli.rs` | ~0% | CLI arg parsing exercised only by the binary, not the lib |
| `extract/log.rs` | ~10% | Extraction-log rendering used by binary output paths |
| `diagnostics.rs` | ~15% | Structured diagnostics serialisation |
| `verify.rs` | ~62% | Verification traversals partly covered via `verify_filecore_volume` |
| `extract/report.rs` | ~64% | Report/JSON rendering |

These aren't format cells; they'd need CLI/integration tests (or a public API)
to raise. The format matrix above is the meaningful coverage statement.
